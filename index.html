          <q>
            Jordan born and raised in Alberta, Peterson obtained bachelor's
            degrees in political science and psychology from the University of
            Alberta and a PhD in clinical psychology from McGill University.
            After researching and teaching at Harvard University, he returned to
            Canada in 1998 and became a professor of psychology at the
            University of Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, Maps of
            Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, which became the basis for many
            of his subsequent lectures. The book combines psychology, mythology,
            religion, literature, philosophy and neuroscience to analyze systems
            of belief and meaning.For most of his career, Peterson maintained a
            clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week.In the fall of
            2021, Peterson resigned from the employment of the University of
            Toronto, becoming professor emeritus.

            >“You must determine where you have been in your life, so that you
            can know where you are now. If you don’t know where you are,
            precisely, then you could be anywhere. Anywhere is too many places
            to be, and some of those places are very bad. You must determine
            where you have been in your life, because otherwise you can’t get to
            where you’re going. You can’t get from point A to point B unless you
            are already at point A, and if you’re just ‘anywhere’ the chances
            you are at point A are very small indeed.</q
